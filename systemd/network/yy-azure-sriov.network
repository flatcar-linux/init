# With NetworkManager, Azure uses a udev rule matching DRIVERS=="hv_pci".
# This won't work with networkd because it only checks the driver of the
# device itself, not its parents. All we can do instead is blacklist the
# VF driver currently used in Azure. If other drivers come into use, the
# symptom will be a VF interface in the output of "networkctl" which never
# finishes configuring.
